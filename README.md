# Crop-Yield-Prediction-using-ML-ANFIS-HBOA-
This repository contains a project for predicting crop yields using a hybrid model that combines Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Honey Badger Optimization Algorithm (HBOA). The model aims to improve accuracy in yield predictions by integrating the strengths of both techniques.
